# WLOSD

A simple OSD notification daemon - for volume, backlight brightness overlays etc.

Inspired by Avizo - but written in C++!

## Why?

Avizo is great. However I want something that's written in plain C/C++ and is easy to compile
on older systems too.

You can think of this as a port of Avizo to C++.
